/**
 * PixelGrid: a picture written as text, one glyph per pixel, compiled into the
 * ordinary `draw` ops Aseprite already executes.
 *
 * It is the writable half of `look op="ascii"`. A model is far better at
 * laying out a silhouette it can see as rows of characters than at composing
 * it from ellipse/rect/line calls whose result it cannot see until afterwards,
 * so the grid is the authoring format and this file does the rasterising —
 * deterministically, in code, where an off-by-one is a test failure instead of
 * a misplaced limb.
 *
 * Expansion happens here, server-side, like `text`: the Lua extension never
 * learns a new op, and the same compiler serves the live window and headless.
