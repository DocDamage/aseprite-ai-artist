title: Review a sprite before calling it done
description: Run the mechanical checks and the by-eye checks, then report what you found with evidence instead of declaring success. Use before finishing any pixel-art task, and when the user asks "is this good" or "why does this look off".

# Review a sprite before calling it done

"Done" is a claim. This is how you earn it.

## Procedure

### 1. Mechanical checks

```
validate
```

Reports off-palette colours, semi-transparent pixels, isolated stray pixels,
untagged animation frames, uniform timing and unsaved state — each with a
location where one exists.

Fix every **error**. For each **warning** you do not fix, have a reason and say
it.

For animation, tell `validate` what the cycle is supposed to be, and it checks
that instead of only the generic rules:

```
validate expect={ layerFrames: { "sword-fx": [[3,4]] }, mustNotOverlap: [["sword","head"]] }
```

`layerFrames` flags a layer that is empty inside its frame range or has pixels
outside it (a slash effect leaking into the idle); `mustNotOverlap` flags any
frame where two layers' pixels collide (the blade crossing the face).

### 2. Look at it

```
look op="preview"
```

Work down `rules://07-review-checklist`:

- **Silhouette** — recognisable as one flat shape?
- **Value contrast** — would it survive desaturation?
- **Light** — one direction, everywhere?
- **Ramps** — do shadows hue-shift, or are they just darker?
- **Lines** — even runs, no doubled pixels?
- **Outline** — one style, applied consistently?
- **Banding** — long parallel stripes of adjacent ramp steps?
- **Detail placement** — spent on the face and weapon, not the boots?

If the sprite was drawn from a reference (`reference op="list"` is not empty),
`look op="compare"` on each key frame too. A mismatch the PixelSpec lists as a
deviation is a decision; any other large one — a limb in a different place, a
silhouette that lost its defining shape — is a finding.

### 3. Look closely at anything that felt off

```
look op="ascii"
```

This is where you find the pixel one row too low and the line run of 3 in a
sequence of 2s. If step 2 left you with "something is wrong but I cannot say
what", this is the step that names it.

### 4. For animation

```
look op="filmstrip"
```

Volume consistent? Height consistent? Does it loop? Do contact poses hold
longer? Is there anticipation before strong actions?

Then check the in-betweens one at a time against their neighbours:

```
look op="onion" frame=3
```

Ghosts of frames 2 and 4 under frame 3 show whether the spacing eases or jumps,
and whether a limb changed length on the way — both invisible in a filmstrip.

### 5. Report

State what you checked, what you found, and what you chose not to change:

> Validated clean. Silhouette reads at 1×; value contrast holds desaturated.
> Two compromises: the plume colour snapped from `#e04a6a` to `#ff77a8`
> (ΔE 14) because PICO-8 has nothing closer, and the far arm is 2px thick
> rather than 3 to keep the silhouette from fusing with the torso.

A user can act on a stated compromise. They cannot act on one you hid.

## When the user asks "why does this look off"

Run the same checks, then name the specific cause rather than listing
possibilities. The usual answers, in order of frequency: too many colours, flat
shading, semi-transparent pixels, mushy silhouette, uniform animation timing.
