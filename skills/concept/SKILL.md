title: Design it first — concept sheet and storyboard
description: Before drawing a new character, prop, scene or animation, write an art spec, turn it into a prompt for an image-generation model, and offer the user a choice — have the local Stable Diffusion (Image Studio) generate the concept sheet or storyboard, generate it themselves and send it back, or continue without one. When reference art arrives (from that prompt or from the user), read it into a PixelSpec and import it panel by panel, so the pixel work reproduces a decided design instead of improvising one. Use after the brief for anything drawn from scratch, and whenever the user supplies reference art; skip for edits to existing art.

# Design it first — concept sheet and storyboard

Drawing from nothing asks one model to invent a character, a pose, a camera, a
palette and the placement of every pixel, all at once. It is the step where
generated pixel art falls apart. Split the job:

- **An image model owns the design** — the look of the character, the key
  poses, the storyboard. That is what those models are good at.
- **You own the pixel interpretation** — reading that design into a canvas,
  a palette and a set of shapes, then drawing it with the rules.

The reference is a guide for proportion, pose and colour masses. It is never
the pixels: a concept downscaled onto the canvas is anti-aliased mush, and no
amount of cleanup turns it into pixel art (see *What this must not do*).

## Two modes

| The user gave you | Mode | Start at |
|-------------------|------|----------|
| Only words ("a fire mage with a walk cycle") | **Creative** — spec → prompt → offer | step 1 |
| An image — concept art, a sketch, a screenshot, a sheet | **Reference** — read it, import it | step 5 |
| An edit to art that already exists | neither — use `aseprite:fix` | — |

## Procedure

### 1. Start from the brief

`aseprite:brief` has already fixed canvas size, palette, view, light, outline
and destination. Do not ask any of it again. The prompt needs colours, not a
palette's name: for a preset, read its hex values from the
`knowledge://palettes` resource (no document has to exist yet); for an open
sprite, `palette op="get"`.

### 2. Write the art spec

Short, concrete, in working notes. Everything the image model and, later, you
will be held to:

- **Subject and scenario** — who or what, one line of personality, and for an
  animation what happens from the first frame to the last.
- **Target** — canvas W×H, how many pixels tall the subject stands, view and
  facing, light direction, outline style.
- **Silhouette** — heads tall, the two or three shapes that must read at 1×
  (a pointed hat, a long coat, an oversized sword).
- **Palette** — the exact hex list with roles: outline, skin ramp, cloth ramp,
  metal ramp, accent. Its size is the ceiling.
- **Animation** — cycle, frame count, one line per key pose, timing in ms, loop
  or one-shot. Plan it with `rules://05-animation` (or the `animation-director`
  agent) — the storyboard panels are these keys.
- **Must not** — text, background scenery, props that are not in the brief,
  camera changes between panels.

### 3. Build the prompt

In English whatever language the conversation is in — image models follow
English prompts best. It has to produce something you can slice with
`reference op="import" grid=…`, so the layout contract is not optional:
equal panels, one row, same scale and ground line in every panel, flat
background, no text.

For a character or prop — a **concept sheet**:

```
Pixel art character concept sheet of {subject}: {one-line personality}.
{view} view, {facing}, light from the {light}. Low-resolution pixel art look:
the character is about {height}px tall on a {W}×{H} sprite, hard pixel edges,
no anti-aliasing, no gradients, {outline style} outline.
Palette — use only these colours: {hex list with roles}.
Layout: {n} panels in a single horizontal row, equal width, evenly spaced,
the same character at the same scale in every panel, feet on the same ground
line: {panel 1: front | panel 2: side | panel 3: back | …}.
Flat plain {#ffffff or #808080} background, no scenery, no text, no labels,
no borders, no watermark.
```

For an animation — a **storyboard**, one panel per frame:

```
Pixel art animation storyboard of {subject} performing a {cycle}.
{view} view, facing {facing}, camera locked, light from the {light}.
Low-resolution pixel art look: the character is about {height}px tall on a
{W}×{H} sprite, hard pixel edges, no anti-aliasing, {outline style} outline.
Palette — use only these colours: {hex list with roles}.
Layout: exactly {N} panels in a single horizontal row, equal width, evenly
spaced, identical character size and ground line in every panel — each panel
is one frame, left to right:
1. {key pose 1}
2. {key pose 2}
…
{N}. {key pose N}
Flat plain {background} background, no motion lines, no text, no numbers,
no borders, no watermark.
```

Ask for both when the request is an animated character: the sheet fixes the
design, the storyboard fixes the motion. Fill every `{…}` — a prompt with a
placeholder left in it produces a generic character.

### 4. Offer the choice — once, in one message

Put the prompt in a single fenced code block, so it copies in one action. If
the brief is still awaiting confirmation, this is the same message — decisions,
prompt, choice — not a second round trip. Then offer exactly these options,
through the harness's question tool when it has one (Claude Code's
AskUserQuestion, omp's `ask`), otherwise as a numbered list:

1. **"Generate it here with Stable Diffusion"** — only when Image Studio is
   running on this machine (see *Local generation* below; check before
   offering). You generate the reference yourself and carry on. Recommend this
   one when it is available: it is local, free and needs nothing from the user.
2. **"I'll generate references"** — the user pastes the prompt into any image
   model (ChatGPT, Gemini, Midjourney, …) and sends the result back. Ask for
   the image **as a file path** — saved to disk, or dragged into the chat where
   the harness turns that into a path — because `reference import` reads
   files, not pixels you have only seen in the conversation.
3. **"Continue without references"** — go straight to drawing from the spec.
   The spec still binds: it is the design now.

If your harness has another image-generation tool, add it as a further option
("you generate it"), never as a silent default. When the user chooses option
2, stop and wait for the image; do not start drawing in the meantime.

#### Local generation — Image Studio (Stable Diffusion)

Image Studio is a local front end for Stable Diffusion that listens on
`http://127.0.0.1:8200`. It has to be started by the user; never try to start
it yourself.

- **Is it there?** `curl -s -m 3 http://127.0.0.1:8200/api/config` — any JSON
  back means yes. No answer: leave option 1 out of the offer and say in one
  line that starting Image Studio would add it.
- **Generate** — one call per image, with the prompt from step 3 unchanged and
  the number of panels it asks for:

  ```
  curl -s -m 600 -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8200/api/concept \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt": "…", "panels": 4}'
  ```

  It answers once, after about a minute (longer the first time, while the
  model loads): `{"file": "<full path to a PNG>", "width": …, "height": …,
  "panels": …}`. Build the JSON body with a tool that escapes quotes and
  newlines properly rather than by hand. An `error` field instead of `file`
  means it did not work — status 409 is "busy with another job": wait and try
  once more, then fall back to offering options 2 and 3.
- **Look at it before trusting it** — open the file. A local model follows the
  layout contract less strictly than a hosted one: count the panels, check they
  are the same scale and on one ground line. One retry with the same prompt is
  fine (each call uses a new seed); if it is still wrong, import the usable
  panels one at a time with `region` instead of `grid`, and note what was
  dropped as a deviation.
- A concept sheet and a storyboard are two calls, one after the other — Image
  Studio does one job at a time.
- Then continue at step 5 with the returned `file` as the reference path.

### 5. Read the reference into a PixelSpec

Look at the image first, then write down what you read — before any pixel is
placed. This is where the design becomes decisions you can check against:

```json
{
  "canvas": [32, 32],
  "view": "front-3/4",
  "source": { "path": "…/storyboard.png", "panels": 4, "panelSize": [256, 256] },
  "silhouette": { "head": [11, 3, 20, 11], "torso": [10, 12, 22, 22], "staff": [23, 2, 25, 30] },
  "landmarks": { "eyesY": 8, "waistY": 18, "feetY": 30 },
  "palette": { "outline": "#1d2b53", "robe": ["#7e2553", "#ff004d"], "skin": ["#ab5236", "#ffccaa"] },
  "frames": ["contact, staff forward", "down, 1px lower", "pass, 1px higher", "up"],
  "deviations": ["belt buckle and runes dropped — 1px at this size is noise"]
}
```

- **Coordinates are target pixels**, not source pixels: scale what you see down
  to the canvas and write the result. Bounding boxes are `[x0, y0, x1, y1]`.
- **Palette**: sample the panel — `reference op="sample_palette" path=… region=…`
  — then map each colour mass onto the sprite palette. Do not adopt the
  sampled colours; an image model's "four colours" are forty.
- **Deviations** are the design decisions the pixel version makes on purpose:
  what does not survive at this size and is simplified or dropped. Listing
  them here is what lets the review loop tell a deliberate change from a miss.
- No reference (the user chose to continue)? Write the same PixelSpec from the
  art spec alone. It is still the thing the drawing is checked against.

### 6. Import it

After `aseprite:new` has made the document:

- **A concept sheet** — import the panel for the view you are drawing:
  `reference op="import" path=… region={x, y, width, height}` (source pixels).
- **A storyboard** — create the frames first (`frame op="add" count=N-1`),
  then one call puts panel i on frame i of a single reference layer:
  `reference op="import" path=… grid={columns: N, rows: 1}`. Panels that are not
  evenly spaced: one `region` import per panel, each with its `frame`.
- `look op="compare"` on frame 1: the left half is what you imported. Wrong
  panel, or the character cut off? Fix the region now, not after drawing.

### 7. Hand over to drawing

`aseprite:draw` (or `aseprite:animate` for a storyboard) does the work, over
the reference. The loop that makes a reference pay off:

1. `look op="compare"` — reference left, art right, same scale.
2. Name the **three to five largest mismatches** — silhouette, proportion,
   pose, placement of colour masses. Not "improve it": a list.
3. Fix only those, in one `draw` call.
4. Compare again. Stop when every remaining mismatch is a listed deviation.

Two rounds is normal. Remove the reference layer before export
(`reference op="remove"`) — `aseprite:export` checks for it.

## What this must not do

- **Pixelize the concept.** Importing the reference and calling it the art,
  copying its pixels through `read_pixels` into `draw`, or recolouring it into
  the palette all produce the same AI mush. Draw the sprite; use the reference.
- **Ask twice.** The spec, the prompt and the choice are one message.
- **Hide the prompt in prose**, translate it, or leave `{placeholders}` in it.
- **Draw while waiting** for a reference the user said they would send.
- **Treat the reference as more authoritative than the brief.** If the image
  model changed the palette, the view or added a cape nobody asked for, the
  brief wins — note it as a deviation.
