# Props and items: weapons, potions, chests, keys, shields

Props expose every error in a scene because their geometry is exact: a chest whose lid
and body use two different cameras, a sword in white, a potion with no glass. Items are
also read at a glance and at 1×, so silhouette and one clear material cue matter more
than detail. Forms underneath: `rules://72-3d-forms`. Materials: `rules://22-materials-hard`.

## Rules

1. **Silhouette first.** Fill the item with one flat colour; it must still name itself at
   1×. Reduce to an iconic outline and about six colours before any detail.
2. **Size is dictated by the world.** A 16 px tile means 16×16 items; a big prop (large
   chest) may half-fill 32×32. Break tall things into tile-sized pieces. Colour budget:
   8×8 item 3–4 colours, 16×16 ≤ 6 (simple item 3–4), 32×32 5–9.
3. **One projection and one light across the whole set.** Side view or tilted 3/4, not
   both; a cabbage drawn straight-on among tilted vegetables is the classic break
   (`rules://70-perspective`).
4. **Fit the icon square.** Long objects (swords, keys, tools) are tilted 30–45° to fill
   it, or kept upright when the set is upright. Keep a 1 px margin at 16 px (art 14×14),
   8–10% on larger icons. No text.
5. **Chibify.** Fat hilt, big bulb, oversized key bow, short neck: proportions that
   survive scaling beat real ones.
6. **Ramp length:** 3 tones per material at 16 px, 5 by default, 7+ only on big surfaces.
   Share swatches between materials so a small palette feels bigger
   (`rules://20-color-for-pixel-art`).
7. **Metal is grey or blue-grey, never white.** A small specular pixel, two faces on a
   blade (lit and dark), lights cooler and less saturated, darks warmer. Selective outline:
   brighter where the light hits. Shine sits anywhere along the blade, small relative to it.
8. **Sword anatomy:** pommel, grip, cross-guard, blade (edge, centre ridge or fuller, point).
   Hilt has three colour zones (pommel, grip, guard). Shade the grip as a cylinder (columns,
   `rules://72-3d-forms`). A 1 px shadow between grip and guard separates them and makes the
   guard read thicker. The same template gives an axe (thicker blade), dagger (short), staff
   (recolour). Claymore quatrefoil ends vanish below ~48 px.
9. **Potion: four things** (liquid, glass, plug, reflection). Show glass first as a border only,
   then a few short curved highlights on bulb and neck; shade away from the highlight. A
   half-empty bottle has a lighter circular liquid surface with a wavy edge. Bubbles last.
   Translucency by blending glass and liquid colour, only in bright areas, and not below 16 px
   (use a lighter ring plus a 2 px curved highlight).
10. **Chest, barrel, crate, pot:** outline → single flat base → split into volumes (lid vs body,
    rim, bevel) → 2–3 shading steps → details (bands, lock, bolts). Round tops are ellipses;
    metal bands are contrasting lines that follow the form. Sit them on a ground patch with a
    short cast shadow; bake the shadow in only when it stays inside the frame.
11. **Shield:** a field, a rim and one big simple emblem (cross, chevron, boss). The shape is
    symmetric, so break symmetry with light: rim light on the top and lit side, a shade value on
    the far half. Heater, round, kite shapes carry different personalities.
12. **Key:** bow (ring), shaft, bit (teeth). The bow is the readable part: a D=7 circle with a
    small hole. Leave a gap between teeth so the outline shows a notch.
13. **Firearms:** learn the pistol (rear and front sight, slide, trigger, grip, magazine); a
    rifle is a big pistol plus extras. Invent by exaggerating one part (huge slide, many screws,
    scope) or by function: muzzle, magazine, grip placed on a random silhouette. Bows: grip,
    arrow rest, limbs, string; arrows: nock, fletching, shaft, point.
14. **Gems are flat facets:** table, crown, girdle, pavilion. 16 px: outline, 3 facet value bands,
    1 white point, 1 dark facet opposite; 8 px: 2 bands + 1 point. A cabochon (dome) uses a ramp
    instead. Shine lights each facet as a whole, the middle frames covering the largest area.
15. **Food and organic props:** dark outline keeps them cartoony; limit colours and reuse them
    across the set; unlimited colour without outline looks like a shrunken photo.
16. **Tech props:** panel divisions with screws, repeating patterns, hazard stripes, antennas as
    connected verticals, cables organic and segmented; right angles only in chip texture.
17. **Idle conventions, one system per game:** ground items bounce, floating items bob, currency
    shines, shine is wrong on food, complex items never rotate (a coin may). A shine on a flat
    disc travels along its edge, not across the face. Pickup feedback: currency plays in place,
    stat items play on the character, one radial flash style for all.
18. **Props echo their owner:** a faction emblem repeats the faction's shapes. Show damage as
    states of the same silhouette. Light-emitting props get concentric glow rings
    (`rules://80-vfx-fire-smoke-magic`).
19. **Held items:** dark line between hand and grip, the item crosses the hand in front, its mass
    leaves the silhouette on a different axis than the arm (`rules://34-hands-and-feet`).

**props-sword-diag-19x20** — the same sword at 45°, tip up-right, drawn on 1:1 bands: every
row shifts one pixel, so the blade (3 interior px: two light, one shade), both outline edges and
the 5-step guard are perfect 1:1 diagonals with no doubled pixels. Light blade face on the
upper-left, shade on the lower-right; guard is a 1:1 line crossing the blade at right angles.
Rule: pick the band direction first, then fill each row as `outline, light, light, shade, outline`
moved one column per row.

```grid props-sword-diag-19x20
K = outline        #2b2433
W = blade-light    #e4eaf2
S = blade-shade    #8d9db5
G = guard-light    #f2c14e
g = guard-shade    #b8862e
B = grip-light     #9a5c3e

**props-barrel-16** — side-on barrel: bulged outline (rows 10, 12, 14 wide), light rim on top,
stave seams every 4 px, two metal hoops (light row over dark row) at the widest rows, light on the
left and core shade on the right. Same layout gives a keg, a pot or a water butt.

```grid props-barrel-16
K = outline        #2b1d2e
R = rim-light      #d8a066
L = wood-light     #c58a50

## Procedure

1. Pick size from the world's tile; choose projection and light; write the colour budget.
2. `draw` op `grid` the silhouette in one colour; `look` op `preview` at 1×. Fix shape now.
3. Split into volumes/materials (blade vs hilt, lid vs body, glass vs liquid) with flat roles.
4. Build one ramp per material with `palette` op `ramp`; add 2–3 steps per material in light
   order; add the one specular/glint pixel last.
5. Add details only where they name a part (band, rivet, keyhole); one cast shadow layer.
6. Outline selectively (`rules://04-outlines-and-edges`); `look` op `ascii` for orphans;
   `validate`.

## Mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Sword looks like a white stick | Blade drawn in white | Blue-grey two-tone blade, 1 px spec |
| Guard fuses with grip | No separation | 1 px shadow under the guard, darker grip |
| Potion reads as a red ball | Glass missing | Border and curved glint, cork on top |
| Chest looks flat | One value for lid and body | Split volumes, shade the underside |
| Item clipped by the icon edge | No margin | Art 14×14 inside 16×16 |
| Set looks mismatched | Mixed projection, outline or light | One style sheet, one light |
| Gem is a coloured blob | Gradient facets | Flat facets, one white point |

## Review

- Single-colour silhouette identifies the item at 1×.
- Anatomy named: guard/grip/pommel; liquid/glass/cork; lid/body/bands; field/rim/emblem.
- Metal not white; two faces shown; one specular at most.
- One projection and one light shared with the rest of the set.
- Colour count within budget; margin kept; no orphan pixels.
- Idle/pickup conventions consistent with sibling items.
