# Water

Water drawn as a blue fill with white dashes looks like a rug. It needs three things at once: a depth
gradient, a surface layer that moves less than one pixel at a time, and a reflection or shore that is
cut into strips instead of mirrored whole. This file covers still water, flowing water, waterfalls,
reflections and animated tiles. Particle foam and rain are `rules://82-particles-and-weather`; tile
connection logic is `rules://66-tiles-and-autotiling`; ice and slime are `rules://22-materials-hard`
and `rules://23-materials-soft`.

## Essentials

- Water is a vertical gradient: dark near (tinted by the bed) → sky-coloured far, as hard bands joined with a dithered checker row.
- Low-contrast base plus a small overlay: overlay ≤30 % of pixels, 1–2 px wavy dashes 4–7 px long. Sea and grass must not share one noise structure.
- Surface: each ripple is one chunk moving ≤1 px per frame in a small closed loop; base tile scrolls 0.5 px/frame. 2–4 frames for a tile, 8 frames at ~8 fps for ocean waves.
- Shore from land: sand → wet sand → thin foam line → light shallows → mid → deep, with a 1-px darker separation line. Foam sweeps along one diagonal.
- Reflect only upright objects: mirror at the contact line, shorten ~25 %, darken one step, cut into 1-px strips shifted ±1 px, fade the lowest third.
- Waterfall = mouth + flow + splash. Loop shift must divide the pattern period (period 8, shift 2 → 4 frames); streaks ~3 px at the lip, 5–10 px below; bridge seams with margin bands.
- Depth ramp: warm bed → olive-green → teal → blue-green → indigo.

Common mistakes:

- Rug of white dashes → depth bands, overlay ≤30 %.
- Ripples jump or twinkle → one chunk each, ≤1 px per frame.
- Reflection is a perfect mirror → darken, shorten, strip ±1 px, fade.
- Waterfall looks static → short streaks at the lip, long below.

## Rules

**Colour and depth**

1. Water is a vertical gradient. Looking steeply into near water you see through it: dark, transparent,
   tinted by the bed (green-brown). Far water at a shallow angle mirrors the sky: the sky ramp, one or two
   steps darker. Default: dark near → sky-coloured far, as hard bands joined with a dithered
   checker row (`rules://13-dithering-and-texture`).
2. Reflected light objects are slightly *darker* than the objects. Dark objects (trees, hulls) reflect
   weakly or vanish. Shadows on clear deep water vanish; on turbid water (brown-green cast) they are soft.
   At dusk, clear water reflects the cool sky evenly.
3. Depth ramp for underwater and streams: shallows show the warm bed (red-brown, ochre) → olive-green →
   teal → blue-green → indigo. Red goes first (about 3 m), oranges by about 7.6 m; below that only blue,
   cyan and violet, with low contrast. Horizontal distance acts like depth. Add warm light only if there
   is a source (lamp, flash).
4. Keep a low-contrast base and a small overlay. Measured saint11 tile (16×16): base `#627aea` with 17 %
   flecks one step darker (`#5b6ee1`); overlay mid `#639bff` 28 %, cyan glint `#5fcde4` 7 %, pale
   `#cbdbfc` under 2 %; the rest transparent. Overlay shapes are 1–2 px thick wavy dashes, 4–7 px long,
   pale pixels next to cyan ones. Sea and grass must not share one noise structure.

**Surface animation**

5. Two layers. Top: wave shapes (think circles changing size) where nothing moves more than 1 px, each
   ripple one chunk, never split into parts; ripples travel a small closed loop (up, left, down, right) with
   no rest frame. Bottom: the base tile scrolls right at constant speed (0.5 px/frame in saint11's 100 ms
   loop). Add small bright spots on wave tips and move them slightly.
6. Waves: build a chain of ovals as a loopable guide: circles give short deep waves, wide ovals shallow ones;
   crests are steeper than troughs, so use asymmetric ovals. A sine is fine for small narrow waves. Frame
   budget: 2–4 frames for a tile; 8 frames at ~8 fps for ocean waves or they look choppy.
7. Surface sparkle is a 6-frame loop of simple linear moves; bright patches mirror the clouds above. Animate
   tiles inside each autotile index. Rivers without a grid: small pulsing-line loops (4 frames) where flow shows.
8. Blend trick for wet contrast: duplicate the water layer, lower one *multiply*, the upper *overlay*, both ~50 %.

**Shores and edges**

9. Shore stack from land: sand (grey-green yellow, not cartoon yellow) → wet sand, darker → thin foam line →
    shallow (lightest, bed visible) → mid → deep. Give sand/water a 1-px darker separation line. Silber's
    top-down sea darkens near the beach, but Gurney's stream ramp puts light shallows over darker deeps. Use the
    light shallows with a dark line: it keeps both the separation and the physics.
10. Edge animation menu: *undulate* (edge pixels 1 px up, left, down, right), *expand/contract* (rest, −1, rest, +1;
    cheap, but the water area visibly grows), *side waves* (¼ of the edge contracts, ¼ expands, shifting a
    quarter per frame over 4 frames), *ocean waves* (expand with a transparent under-wave, slower
    contraction, 8 frames). Animating the inner outline only keeps the coast calm. Foam sweeps along one
    diagonal, it does not pulse everywhere. RPG Maker-style water autotile = 3 frames played 1-2-3-2-1, the
    land connection drawn on the side frames.

**Reflections**

11. Reflect only upright objects (people, trees, posts), never flat things (cobblestones). Mirror about the
    object's ground-contact line, shorten the copy about 25 %, darken one ramp step, desaturate ~10, keep
    only the silhouette's big shapes.
12. Break it: cut the reflection into horizontal 1-px strips and shift alternate strips ±1 px in a 2-row
    period. Vertical lines survive, horizontal lines break; light breeze turns reflections into webs of
    vertical strokes. Fade the lowest third by replacing every other pixel with water colour. Add a few
    glints on crests.
13. Animate by swapping the strip offsets on alternate frames (rows 0/1 ↔ 1/0), or with a slow ripple distort
    whose source sits off the bottom edge so waves travel one way (PB10: speed 0.5, width 10, height 3).
    Pad the layer with transparent space and render with hard pixels.

**Waterfalls, streams, underwater**

14. A waterfall is three parts: **mouth** (lip, brightest, with reflections), **flow** (vertical bands that sag
    and darken as they fall and break up toward the bottom) and **splash** (foam particles, looped in sync).
    Shake the column ±1 px. A narrow fall has a twisting V highlight; two overlays at different speeds widen
    the wave as it falls.
15. Loop the flow by shifting the streak pattern down with wrap. The shift per frame must divide the pattern
    period: period 8, shift 2 → 4 frames (the template); or 16 px with shifts 6, 5, 5. Apparent speed comes from
    the *length* of each streak segment, not the cycle speed: short at the lip (about 3 px), long below
    (5–10 px). Bridge each seam between segments with a margin band: its top half takes the last colour above,
    its bottom half the first colour below, otherwise a flash crosses the flow. For transparency, checker two phases
    of the same pattern.
16. Mountain streams: warm shallows, olive, teal, dark pools; rapids = near-white foam in the lightest 1–2 entries with a
    dithered edge, and dark troughs between.
17. Under the surface: a darker translucent purple-blue region; objects displaced by a sine; bubbles with random
    horizontal drift that fade or rise. Caustics = a network of 1-px lines in the lightest water tone on the
    bottom, shifting 1 px in alternating directions over 4–8 frames.
18. Iso water tile sits half a cube lower than land; its texture drops 1 px per frame while highlight pixels
    alternate, 16-frame loop (`rules://71-isometric`).

## By size

| Canvas | Surface | Reflection / edge | Waterfall |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| 8 px | 2 tones, 2-px dashes, 2 frames | 1 px darker copy, no strips | 2-px streaks, 2 frames |
| 16 px | base + 3-tone overlay, 4 frames (`water-tile-16-x4`) | foam line + 1 shallow band | 12–16 px wide, 3–4 frames |
| 32 px | + caustic lines, sparkle | strips ±1 px, fade lowest third | mouth + flow + splash, 4–6 frames |
| 64 px | ripple chains, 2 overlays at two speeds | webbed vertical strokes | two overlays, foam as particles |

## Procedure

1. `sprite_info`. Decide the water type (tile, side-view, fall, reflection), frame count and loop. Build a water ramp of
   4–5 entries with `palette` op `ramp` or `set`, with hue travel from cyan-teal (light) to indigo (deep).
2. Base on its own layer: `draw` op `rect` fill, flecks with `pixels`, bands with `rect` and `dither` (pattern
   `checker`) on the joins.
3. Overlay on a second layer, `draw` op `grid` for ripples. Add frames with `frame` op `duplicate`; move each ripple chunk by
   re-drawing (≤1 px) or with `cel` op `move` for a whole overlay. Tag the loop with `tag` op `create`.
4. Waterfall: draw the period pattern once, then each frame is the pattern shifted down by the step with wrap:
   `draw` op `blit` two pieces (rows 0…H−s to y = s, rows H−s…H to y = 0). The splash is drawn per frame.
5. Reflection: `draw` op `blit` with `flipVertical` from the object (above its contact line) to below it; `recolor` op
   `shade` (−1 step) and `desaturate` on that region; then one `blit` per 2-row strip with `x ± 1` in one `draw` call, last third
   dithered with `dither` (pattern `checker`) against the water colour.
6. `look` op `filmstrip` for the loop and `onion` to check ≤1 px moves; `validate` checks `animation` timing and strays.
   Check tile seams on 3×3 copies.

## Mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Water is a rug of white dashes | No depth gradient, big overlay | Bands + dithered joins; overlay ≤ 30 % of pixels |
| Ripples jump or twinkle | Moved more than 1 px, or split into parts | One chunk per ripple, ≤1 px per frame |
| Reflection is a perfect mirror | No darkening, no strips | Darken, shorten, strip ±1 px, fade |
| Reflection of cobbles under a bridge | Flat objects reflected | Reflect only upright objects |
| Waterfall seems to blink | Seam bridge missing, shift ≠ divisor | Margin bands; period 8 shift 2 |
| Waterfall looks static | Equal streak length top to bottom | Short at the lip, long below |
| Shore looks like a hard seam | Sand and water share a value | Wet sand, foam line, lighter shallows, 1-px dark line |
| Whole coast pulses | Foam animated everywhere | Sweep foam along one diagonal; animate the inner outline |
| Ocean waves choppy | Too few frames | 8 frames at ~8 fps |
| Deep water as bright as shallow | Value-flat ramp | Dark near and deep, sky colour far |

## Review

- Depth gradient present; the near/deep end is darkest and the far end matches the sky.
- Ripple moves ≤1 px per frame, each ripple one connected chunk; loop closes (filmstrip).
- Reflection is upright objects only, darker, shorter, strip-offset, faded; no perfect mirror.
- Shore stack is readable: sand, wet sand, foam, shallow, mid, deep.
- Waterfall has lip, flow, splash; streak period divides the loop; speed grows down the fall.
- No water colour is brighter than the sky it mirrors; no black outlines around water.
