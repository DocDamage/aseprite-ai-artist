# Small creatures

Fish, bugs, frogs and snakes get drawn as miniature mammals: a fish with a head and
shoulders, an insect with four legs and a face, a snake as a stiff tube. Each group
has a short list of parts that must be present and a movement that is unlike a
mammal's. This file gives part counts, proportions and templates for fish, insects and
spiders, frogs and snakes, and the cheapest animation that sells each. Blob monsters
(slimes) and big creatures are `rules://54-monster-design`; wings are
`rules://52-birds-and-flight`; quadrupeds are `rules://50-quadrupeds`.

## Essentials

- Count parts before drawing. Fish: body, tail, dorsal, belly and pectoral fins, gill arc, eye. Insect: 3 segments, 6 legs from the thorax, 2 antennae. Spider: 2 segments, 8 legs, no antennae. Frog: raised eyes, 2 big folded hind legs, no tail. Snake: tube, wedge head, no limbs.
- At 8 px one idea plus an eye or colour dot; 12–16 px use 2–3 colours, a body colour plus one contrasting accent. Colour, not outlines, separates fins from body.
- Fish: tail fan ¼–⅓ of body length, eye in the front third, dorsal on the top third, dark back and light belly, stripes follow the body curve.
- Swim by an S wave: 4 frames, tail up 1 px, centre, down 1 px, centre; body tilts 1 px opposite; fins flutter on a different period.
- Insects: tripod legs, 2 segments each, knees out and up. Wings pale blue-white with 1–2 vein pixels, drawn behind the thorax. Antennae 2–3 px, unoutlined.
- Frog hop is a bouncing ball: coil, full stretch, landing squash. Snake: body follows the head's track, constant wave, shift about a quarter wave per frame.
- Small things move in jerks: 4-frame walk at 80 / 80 / 120 / 80 ms; squash ≤ 1 px at 16 px.

Mistakes:
- Fish with shoulders → no taper → one smooth oval into the tail.
- Insect with four legs → three pairs from the thorax.
- Outlines on 1 px legs and antennae → draw them after the outline pass.
- Snake as a rigid tube → add wave, narrowing tail, per-frame wave shift.

## Rules

1. **Count the parts before you draw.** Fish: body, tail, dorsal fin, belly fin, pectoral
   fin, gill arc, eye. Insect: 3 body segments (head, thorax, abdomen), 6 legs (3 pairs on
   the thorax), 2 antennae, 0 or 2–4 wings on the thorax. Spider: 2 body segments, 8 legs,
   no antennae. Frog: head with raised eyes, body, 2 big folded hind legs, 2 short arms,
   no tail. Snake: a tube with a wedge head, no limbs. A sprite missing one of its parts
   reads as a different animal.
2. **One idea per sprite at 8 px, one accent pixel.** 8 px: silhouette plus an eye or a
   colour dot. 12–16 px is the minion size (about half the hero's height); keep to 2–3
   colours, a main body colour plus a contrasting accent (a green fish with yellow lips and
   fins), and let colour, not outlines, separate fins from the body (Pixel Logic).
3. **Fish: tail fan = a quarter to a third of body length (derived).** Dorsal fin on the top
   third, belly fin below the mid-line, eye in the front third, large and high, gill arc one
   body-height behind the eye. Countershade: dark back, light belly. Stripes and bands follow
   the body curve; straight vertical stripes look like a sticker.
4. **Swim by waving, not by sliding.** A fish moves as an S wave from head to tail with the
   tail lagging; the tail's trailing edge wavers 1–2 px, half object colour and half background
   (Ferrari, fish tails and corals). Four frames: tail up 1 px, tail centre, tail down 1 px,
   tail centre; body tilts 1 px opposite to the tail; fins flutter on a different period
   (`rules://45-secondary-motion`).
5. **Water changes colour.** Deeper means bluer and less saturated: red goes first, then
   orange and yellow (Gurney: red is gone within about 10 ft / 3 m, orange and yellow by about
   25 ft / 7.6 m). A deep-water fish keeps its warm accent small or darkens it.
6. **Insects: tripod legs.** Three legs per side, each 2 segments with the knee outward and up;
   when walking, three legs (front and hind on one side, middle on the other) move together
   and the other three plant (derived from standard insect gait). Antennae are 2–3 px dark
   lines, never outlined.
7. **Wings are pale, not transparent.** No alpha: draw wings as a pale blue-white tone with 1–2
   vein pixels, drawn behind the thorax. Fast wings (bee, fly) use 2 frames or a second wing copy as
   blur, not a full flap (`rules://52-birds-and-flight`, Saint11 *Wings*).
8. **Beetle vs bee vs spider silhouettes.** Beetle: one oval shell split down the middle, head a
   darker cap, 6 legs poking out. Bee or wasp: the three segments visible, striped abdomen, wings up. Spider:
   small round body, 8 thin legs with raised knees; people instinctively fear the thin, long, angular
   shapes, so use them for threats (Saint11).
9. **Frog: coil, stretch, land.** Sit: big thigh mass, arms short, eye bumps on top of the head, mouth a
   single 1 px line across the face. Hop = a bouncing ball: squash on the ground (coiled), full stretch with the
   hind legs extended in the air, landing squash with the front hands first (Blair). Rabbit-style hops
   drop all detail in the fast frames: stretched oval, compact ball at the apex, stretched landing
   (Thomas & Johnston).
10. **Snake: head leads, body follows the path.** Every body segment follows the track of the head, with a
    constant wave amplitude; the wave travels from head to tail. Each frame shifts the wave by about a quarter of
    its length (derived). Head wedge wider than the neck; a 1–2 px forked tongue on the flick frames; belly
    scutes lighter than the back.
11. **Turtle, crab and shells.** Shell is a dome with the head and legs as small separate pieces that can
    withdraw (Blair); the head retracts by hiding behind the shell outline, not by shrinking. Crab: wide
    flat body, 2 claws, 6 small legs, eyes on stalks.
12. **Small things move in jerks.** A mouse or beetle runs in starts and stops, not a smooth cycle; use a 2-frame
    idle, a 4-frame walk and hold lengths (80 / 80 / 120 / 80 ms) instead of more drawings (Thomas & Johnston,
    Bambi's mouse; Sprite Fusion notes). Squash and stretch ≤ 1 px at 16 px (`rules://05-animation`).

## Procedure

1. Write the part list (rule 1) and the colour plan: main body ramp (3 tones), one accent, one belly tone.
   `palette` op `ramp` for the body.
2. Block in the main mass with `ellipse` or `polyline` ops on one layer; add the secondary mass (fin, shell, thigh).
   Check the silhouette: `look` op `preview` at 1× and in one flat colour.
3. Add parts in order of size: tail or legs, fins or wings, eye, the one accent. Place legs, antennae and 1 px
   details **after** the outline pass so they stay single-pixel.
4. Shade from the upper left (top lighter, belly or underside darker); keep stripes on the form.
5. For animation: split fins, tail, wings or legs onto layers (`rules://06-layers-and-rigging`), draw the two extremes
   (tail up / down, squash / stretch, wave phase 0 / ½), then the in-betweens. `look` op `filmstrip`, `frame` op
   `set_duration` with uneven holds, `tag` the loop.
6. `validate`: orphan pixels are allowed only for an eye, a vein or a leg tip that is a single deliberate pixel.

## Mistakes

- **Fish with shoulders** (neck, chin, round head) → body not tapering → one smooth oval into the tail.
- **Insect with four legs, or legs from the abdomen** → rule 1 → three pairs from the thorax.
- **Wings drawn in front of the body as flat blobs** → draw behind, pale, with one vein.
- **Frog that looks like a green dog** → no eye bumps, no folded hind leg → add the thigh Z and the raised eyes.
- **Snake as a rigid tube** → no wave or constant thickness → head wedge, curve narrowing to the tail, wave shifted per frame.
- **Outlines on 1 px legs and antennae** → the outline pass thickens them to 3 px → draw them after the outline.
- **Spider legs that look like a fence** → straight, evenly spaced lines → raise the knees and fan the legs unevenly.
- **Squash too big on a tiny sprite** → ≥ 2 px at 16 px → 1 px only, or use hold timing.
- **Muddy small fish** → black inlines between body and fins → drop the inlines, let colour separate them.

## Review

- Are all parts present (rule 1), and does the silhouette read as the right group in one flat colour?
- Fish: tail fan, dorsal fin, eye in the front third, light belly; stripes follow the form.
- Insects and spiders: 6 or 8 legs, legs from the thorax, antennae as unoutlined 1 px lines.
- Frog: raised eyes, folded hind leg, one mouth line. Snake: head wedge, narrowing tail, belly lighter.
- 1 px features are 1 px wide; no thickened legs.
- Animated loops use two extremes and uneven holds; the wave or hop closes cleanly.
