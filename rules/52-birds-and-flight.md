# Birds and flight

A bird drawn as a mammal with a beak has a knee in the wrong place and a wing that
is a flat paddle. A flap cycle built by tilting one rigid blade up and down looks like
a windmill. This file gives the body plan, the one visible leg joint that people draw
backwards, wing structure for birds and bats, the four-frame flap with body bob and
timing, and the small cases (hover, glide, perch). Quadruped anatomy is
`rules://50-quadrupeds`; follow-through in general is `rules://45-secondary-motion`;
sub-pixel hover is `rules://46-subpixel-animation`.

## Rules

1. **Build a bird from an egg, a ball and a cone.** Body = egg with the breast (keel)
   forward and down and the tail up and back; head = ball; beak = cone or wedge; legs
   = thin lines; the S-shaped neck is long but tucks into the shoulders at rest, so
   draw 2–3 px of it. Owls are fat pears with a big ball head; ducks and geese carry the
   S neck upright (Hultgren, Goldfinger).
2. **The visible leg joint is the ankle, and it bends backward.** The knee is hidden in
   the body feathers. Draw one kink: body → short feathered thigh → ankle (kink pointing
   **back**) → straight tarsus down → toes. Toes: 3 forward and 1 back for chicken, hawk,
   crow and songbirds; 2 forward and 2 back for parrots and woodpeckers; 2 for the ostrich.
   Anatomy gives a visible tarsus of 0.10–0.12 of standing height (chicken: head + neck
   0.35–0.40, body 0.30–0.35, tibia 0.25, tarsus 0.20 of which 0.10–0.12 shows, toes 0.08);
   stylised sprites stretch the visible leg to 0.2–0.3 so the kink reads (derived).
3. **A wing is an arm.** Short humerus against the body, two long parallel bones, a fused
   hand with the long primaries; the thumb carries a small tuft (alula). Elbow and wrist are
   coupled: they bend together or straighten together. Folded, the wing is a Z: upper arm
   back, forearm forward, hand back, tip lying along the tail root. Open, it is nearly a
   straight line from shoulder to tip, leading edge straight, trailing edge scalloped.
4. **Wing bands, three of them.** Leading edge: small coverts, 2–3 px, lightest or patterned.
   Middle: large coverts, 2 px, darker. Trailing: flight feathers as 1–2 px stripes with a
   1 px darker gap; primaries fan out like fingers at the tip, secondaries make a smooth
   rounded edge. At ≤ 16 px collapse to two tones: a light covert patch and a dark tip.
5. **Flap: four key poses, body bob opposite the wing.** Wings up (body lowest, +1) → wings
   mid on the way down (0) → wings fully down (body highest, −2) → wings mid on the way up
   (−1). The body rises fast on the downstroke and sinks 1 px as the wings recover
   (Saint11: up 3 px fast, then 1 px while the wings descend). The wing is two segments (7 + 8 px
   in the templates) so the tip can trail.
6. **Tips trail.** On the downstroke the tip bends up behind the arm; on the upstroke it bends
   down (Blair). In the templates the outer segment turns 20–35° against the inner one.
7. **Which stroke is fast.** Sources disagree: Saint11 makes the upstroke much faster than the
   downstroke; Blair's cartoon chart spends more drawings on the rising wing and a single wide
   drawing on the downstroke. Decision: use Saint11's, because it is measured from a shipped 56-frame
   loop at 80 ms and matches how birds fly (the downstroke is the power stroke, the upstroke is a
   quick folded recovery). Use Blair's snap for a slow, cartoon, heavy bird.
8. **Frame count and speed follow size.** Small birds beat fast, large birds beat slowly (see
   Timing). A convincing flap often needs fewer than 8 frames; at ≤ 16 px use 2 (up, down).
9. **Soaring is a held pose.** Wings flat, the "M" or flat-gull silhouette with finger notches
   at the tips; move 1 px of bob, a tail tilt and a slight wing flex every few frames, not a flap.
10. **Hover and fast wings.** A hovering bird bobs by sub-pixel moves; very fast wings (hummingbird,
    insects) use fewer frames or two wing copies as a light smear, not eight drawings. Falling:
    1 px per frame with the wings rising against the fall.
11. **Bat wings are hands.** Wrist peak, 3–4 finger struts radiating from it, thin membrane
    between them with scalloped trailing edge, a thumb claw at the wrist, body and head tiny.
    A bat at rest hangs head-down with the wings wrapped round the body.
12. **Beak and eye are the lone allowed orphan pixels.** Each is 1 px (2×1 beak at 16–20 px).
    Beak length 0.5–1 × the cranium; upper and lower jaw 1 px each when open. Do not use the beak
    colour anywhere else on the bird (an orange nose reads as a beak) (Cure for the lone-pixel exception,
    Pixel Logic for the misread).
13. **A walking bird is a biped with a reversed knee.** The same contact, down, pass, up structure
    as the human walk, the visible joint pointing back; the head thrusts forward on each step (derived).
    Williams makes the point with ostrich, man and horse (`rules://42-walk-and-run`).
14. **Colour on the underside.** Light breast, darker back; the flight feathers darker than the
    coverts. Put dark on all extremities (tail end, wingtips) of a light bird (Hultgren).

## By size

| Canvas | What survives | Flap |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | A "v" or 3×2 body with two 1 px wing strokes; eye or beak pixel only | 2 frames: wings up, wings down |
| 16 | Egg body 8×6, ball head 4, beak 1–2 px, tail 3, leg 2 px with a 1 px ankle kink, two-tone wing | 2–4 frames |
| 32 | Three wing bands, primaries as fingers, 3+1 toes, ankle kink, breast patch | 4–6 frames |
| 64 | Individual primaries, three covert rows, eye with highlight, feathered thigh | 6–8 frames |

## Timing

| Bird | ms per frame (4-frame loop) | Cycle |
|---|---|---|
| Sparrow / swallow | 40–50 | 160–200 ms |
| Crow / pigeon | 60–80 | 240–320 ms |
| Gull / hawk | 100–140 | 400–560 ms |

Hold the wings-up frame about 1.5× the others (Blair: two ticks at the top), the mid-up frame
shortest. Source ranges: small birds 50–60 ms per frame, large 100–140 ms; Saint11's loop runs at 80 ms.

## Templates

Facing left. Roles map onto your palette; the flap frames share one canvas so the body bob is visible.

## Procedure

1. Pick the bird, canvas and facing. Palette: back, breast, flight feather (3 tones), beak, eye;
   `palette` op `ramp` for the back.
2. Rig with `layer` op `create`: `wing-far`, `tail`, `body`, `head`, `wing-near`, `legs` (omit legs in flight).
   Keep the wing on its own layer so it can move as one piece (`rules://06-layers-and-rigging`).
3. Draw the body egg and head ball, then the beak and eye pixel. Check the silhouette with `look` op `preview`.
4. Wing: draw it open as two segments, then bands (coverts, flight feathers, primaries). Fold it with the Z rule
   for the perched pose.
5. Flap: `frame` op `add` to four frames. Draw wings up, wings down first, then the two mids. Move the body per
   frame with `cel` op `move` using the +1, 0, −2, −1 offsets; add tip trail on the mids.
6. `look` op `filmstrip`, then `look` op `onion`: the wing should sweep an arc and the tip should lag. `frame` op
   `set_duration` from the Timing table; `tag` the loop `fly`. `validate` for orphan pixels (beak and eye are fine).

## Mistakes

- **Bird with a knee** (leg bends forward) → knee drawn instead of the ankle → rule 2, kink points back.
- **Windmill flap** → one rigid blade rotated → two-segment wing with a trailing tip and body bob.
- **Mushy wing** → one flat colour → three bands and darker primaries.
- **Four toes forward** → toe count wrong → 3 forward, 1 back (2 + 2 for parrots).
- **Everything flaps in sync** → body does not move → bob opposite the wing, tail one frame late.
- **Eagle with a pigeon's wing** → no finger notches → notch the trailing edge at the primaries.
- **Fused beak and face** → beak the same colour as the head → give the beak its own tone.
- **Tiny bird with an 8-frame flap at 100 ms** → too slow → 4 frames at 40–50 ms.
- **Bat as a bird with membrane** → wing drawn from the shoulder outward → draw the wrist peak and fingers first.

## Review

- Is there exactly one leg kink and does it point back, with 3 + 1 toes (or the species' count)?
- Wing in three bands with darker primaries, or two tones at ≤ 16 px; folded wing is a Z.
- Flap: body lowest on wings-up, highest on wings-down, tip trailing, not a rigid blade.
- Durations vary and match the bird's size; the wing-up frame is held longest.
- Beak and eye are single pixels; no other orphan pixels; beak colour not reused.
- The loop closes, the cycle is tagged, and `look` op `filmstrip` shows four different silhouettes.
