# Proportions by size

Head count is the first decision in a figure and the one most often made by accident. Seven heads on a 16 px canvas leaves a 2 px head with no face; two heads on a 64 px canvas reads as a toy even when the brief says "veteran". Heads-tall carries age and tone, and the canvas decides how many of them you can afford.

## Rules

1. **Head px = canvas height ÷ heads. The head must be ≥ 4 px tall.** Eyes plus a mouth need 3–4 rows. If the sum comes out below 4, cut the head count; never shrink the face to fit. Table A marks the dead cells.
2. **Head count is tone, not anatomy.** 1–3 toy / cute; 3–4 default game character (classic JRPG sprites measure ≈ 3 heads, head + hair 34–38 % of height); 5–6 teen or grounded; 7½–8 mature adult; 8½–9 noble, elf, heroic, villain. A figure with fewer than 7 heads reads young whatever its face says.
3. **Head size stays near 6–8 px from 24 px upward; spare height goes to torso and legs.** A 4-head figure at 32 px and a 6-head figure at 48 px both have an 8 px head. Do not scale the head with the canvas. (The web "head 14–18 px at 48" figure is a 3-head chibi; this file uses the arithmetic.)
4. **Leg share rises with head count, then plateaus.** 2 heads: legs ≈ 28 % of height; 3 heads ≈ 38 %; 4 heads and up: crotch at the half-way row (at 8 heads the crotch is exactly half; strictly the hip joint is half and the crotch a hair below).
5. **Landmark order is fixed at every size** (rows counted from the top): chin at 1 head; shoulder line ≈ ⅓ head below the chin; elbows level with the navel; wrists level with the crotch; fingertips mid-thigh; knees at ¾ of height; ankle one pixel above the sole. Table B turns this into rows.
6. **Widths by build.** Shoulders, outer edge to outer edge: male 2⅓ heads at 8 heads (2⅔ heroic), female 2 heads; stylised 4–6-head figures run 1.5–2 heads. The female figure differs in shoulder, waist and hip, not in height (about ½ head shorter at most). Hips ≈ shoulders for women.
7. **Cute levers** (use at least three): head 40–60 % of height and as wide as the torso or wider; no neck; eyes below the head's mid-line; short torso; body under 4 heads; limbs short and tapering (3 px at the base, 2 at the end); hands and feet small but never under the size limit. **Weight levers:** small head (⅙), barrel chest ≈ 50 % of height, hands 3×3 on a 24 px body, feet ≥ 4 px wide.
8. **Age ladder, stylised** (Bancroft): baby 2½ heads, child 3½, teen 5+, adult 6. Eyes shrink with age while nose, ears and feet keep growing. On a shared canvas a child is the adult's head plus fewer body rows, not a rescaled adult: on a 32 px adult canvas, 10 yr ≈ 24 px tall with a 7 px head, 5 yr ≈ 19 px with 7, toddler ≈ 14 px with 6 (derived from Loomis's height ratios .73/.58/.45). Template `proportions-ages-32`.
9. **Pick the sprite height from the screen, not the character.** Character height as a share of screen height: platformer ≈ 10–16 %, beat-'em-up ≈ 25 %, fighter ≈ 45 %. Common heights 16 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 128. One pixel scale and one canvas for the whole cast.
10. **Outlines cost room.** At ≤ 24 px outline only the outer silhouette and separate interior parts by colour; a full outline on a 24 px figure makes it stumpy.
11. **Limb width at 16 px.** Two sources disagree (arm 1 px vs ≥ 2 px). Rule: the arm is 2 px *including* its outline column; from 24 px up it is 2 px of colour inside the outline.
12. **Parity decides the centre.** Odd widths give one centre column (symmetric head, legs, buckle); even widths give two. Choose head and torso parity together so the shoulder width matches the head's centre column.
13. **A new size is a redraw.** The same character at world / battle / portrait size is drawn three times. When shrinking, keep silhouette, ground contacts and the biggest accessory, drop the rest (see `rules://14-readability-and-scale`).

## By size

Table A — head height in px (✗ = under 4 px, no face possible):

| canvas | 2 heads | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 8 | 5 | 4 | ✗ 3 | ✗ 3 | ✗ 2 |
| 24 | 12 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 4 | ✗ 3 |
| 32 | 16 | 11 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 4 |
| 48 | 24 | 16 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 |
| 64 | 32 | 21 | 16 | 13 | 11 | 8 |

Table B — default build, pixel rows from the top (row 0), inclusive. Bold = the template exists.

| canvas | heads | head rows | shoulder | elbow | crotch | fingertip | knee | sole | width over arms | arm | hand | leg (thigh/shin) | foot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 2.7 (**mannequin**) | 0–5 | 6 | – | 10 | 9 | 13 | 15 | 9 | 1 + outline | 1×1 | 2 | 3×1 |
| 24 | 3 | 0–7 | 8 | 11 | 15 | 14 | 19 | 23 | 11 | 2 | 2×2 | 3 | 4×2 |
| 32 | 4 (**mannequin**) | 0–7 | 9 | 13 | 16 | 18 | 24 | 31 | 13 | 2 | 2×3 | 3 / 3 | 5×2 |
| 48 | 6 (**mannequin**) | 0–7 | 9 | 18 | 24 | 27 | 36 | 47 | 19 | 4 / 3 | 3×4 | 4 / 3 | 6×2 |
| 64 | 8 realistic | 0–7 | 11 | 24 | 32 | 37 | 48 | 63 | 19 male, 16 female | 5 / 4 | 4×6, fingers 1 px | 7 / 5 | 8×3 |
| 64 | 6 stylised | 0–10 | 12 | 24 | 32 | 38 | 48 | 63 | 22 | 5 / 4 | 4×6 | 8 / 6 | 9×3 |

Rows for 24, 64 and the 3-head 32 px figure are derived from the landmark order in rule 5; the 16 / 32 / 48 rows are read off the templates. The cute 32 px variant is 3 heads: head 0–10, torso 11–19, crotch 20, legs 12 rows.

Table C — 8-head realistic landmarks (rows from the top; u = canvas ÷ 8):

| canvas | u | chin | shoulder | nipple | navel | crotch | fingertip | knee |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 48 | 6 | 6 | 8 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 28 | 36 |
| 64 | 8 | 8 | 11 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 37 | 48 |
| 96 | 12 | 12 | 16 | 24 | 36 | 48 | 56 | 72 |

Below 48 px an 8-head figure is not drawable; use 4–6 heads.

`proportions-ages-32` — one cast on a shared 32 px adult canvas, feet on one baseline: toddler (columns 0–6, 14 px tall, head 6), 5 yr (10–16, 19 px, head 7), 10 yr (20–26, 24 px, head 7), adult (30–38, 32 px, head 8). The head barely changes; the body rows do. Use it to place a child next to an adult.

`proportions-mannequins-16-32-48` — flat colour-coded dummies (head yellow, torso purple, arms green, legs pink, neck / hands / feet / elbows / knees brown) bottom-aligned on one baseline: 16 px at columns 0–8, 32 px at 12–24, 48 px at 28–46. Draw the one that matches the canvas on a hidden "dummy" layer, build the character over it, then delete it. Joint marks show elbow, knee and ankle rows.

## Procedure

1. Write the tone in one line, map it to a head count (rule 2), compute head px (Table A). Under 4 px: lower the count.
2. `sprite_manage` to confirm the canvas; `layer` op create "dummy". Draw the matching mannequin with `draw` op grid (feet on the bottom row), or lay a guide line with `draw` op line at every head unit.
3. `look` op preview at 1× next to the ladder for the read; `look` op ascii to verify landmark rows against Table B.
4. Adjust one segment at a time: `draw` op blit the region to its new x/y, then `draw` op clear the old one, comparing against the other segments (`transform` op translate moves a whole cel only). Fix proportions before any colour.
5. Dress the dummy (`rules://35-hair-and-clothing`); keep tight clothing first so anatomy is not hidden.
6. Hide the dummy, run `validate`, then `look` op preview again. Check silhouette against `rules://03-silhouette-and-form`.

## Mistakes

- Face is a smear → head under 4 px → cut heads or enlarge the canvas.
- Adult brief reads as a child → head count under 6 or legs under half → add rows to legs, shrink head share.
- 48 px sprite has a 14 px head and still "looks small" → head scaled with the canvas → hold head at 6–8 px (rule 3).
- Stubby 24 px figure → outline on every part → outline the silhouette only (rule 10).
- Whole cast has the same build → same head share and shoulder width → vary heads by ±1 and width by role.
- Crotch far below the middle on a "heroic" figure → leg rows stolen by the torso → crotch at row H/2.
- Child made by shrinking an adult → head ratio unchanged → keep head px, remove body rows (rule 8).

## Review

- Head px matches Table A for the stated style and is ≥ 4.
- Crotch row ≈ H/2 for ≥ 4 heads; knee ≈ ¾ H; wrists level with the crotch.
- Head, torso and leg rows are three different masses, not equal thirds.
- Female / male differ in shoulder and hip width, not in head count.
- Every character in the set shares one pixel scale.
