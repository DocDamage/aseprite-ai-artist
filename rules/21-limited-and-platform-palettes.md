# Limited and platform palettes

A palette limit is a design tool, not a handicap: it forces harmony and fast decisions. But "retro" without the real limits is
just a costume — a NES sprite with eight colours, a Game Boy sprite with a fifth shade. This file gives the numbers per platform,
the budget per sprite size, how to cut a palette without losing the read, and ready-to-load hex lists.
Era *style* (outlines, dither habits, tile conventions) is in `rules://90-platform-styles`; ramp theory in `rules://20-color-for-pixel-art`.

## Rules

1. **Choose palette and budget before the first pixel, and say them back.** Counts include transparency: a "16-colour" sprite is 15 + transparent.
2. **"8-bit" and "16-bit" name the CPU, not the palette.** NES, C64, Master System and ZX Spectrum have four different palettes. Use the table below; GIF is 256 (8 bpp).
3. **The per-tile / per-sprite limit binds harder than the total.** NES: 3 colours + transparent per sprite, and per 16×16 background cell. Game Boy and GBC sprites: 3 + transparent.
   SNES, Genesis, GBA: 15 + transparent per tile or sprite. Honour it inside every 8×8 block even when the Aseprite palette is larger.
4. **Default sizes when the user has no preference.** "Retro/8-bit" → PICO-8 (16, forgiving). "Game Boy" → 4 shades. "NES-like" → 3 colours + transparent per sprite, ≈ 25 on screen.
   "SNES/GBA/Genesis-like" → 15 per sprite from short hue-shifted ramps. Named game → `reference` op `sample_palette`.
5. **Reduction ladder (a 24-colour sprite, measured).** 24 → 20: swap greys for skin tones, drop the barely visible darkest teal. → 15: fuse skin with brown hair, share one highlight between green and teal, drop orange AA.
   → 10: reuse a skin tone for the shirt highlight, recolour the greens onto the teal ramp, fuse the darkest shades. Below ≈ 10 *that* sprite collapsed; 16 is the usual ceiling. No universal number — cut in this order, `look` after each cut.
6. **Reuse swatches across unrelated objects, never across touching ones.** Hair red = bed red = night-stand red is good; hair against a wall of the same red merges. Give touching objects different colours.
7. **4 shades (Game Boy / 4-colour):** value only. Keep darkest and lightest far apart and let the two mids do the shading. No mid-to-mid border thinner than 1 px (it vanishes on LCD ghosting, derived). Use maximum anti-aliasing: these sprites sit on pale backgrounds.
   On GBC/GBA-style LCDs keep the darkest tone clearly above black (low intensities crush). If it does not work in 4 colours, more colours will not save it.
8. **1-bit:** lines, a few solid blocks and dither; build the icon on the single most recognisable feature; outline may be black, white, or both (double line); compensate with fluid animation.
9. **Dither multiplies a palette, with discipline.** A checker between two colours adds one tone: 4 colours + dither of the 4 = ≈ 10 tones (≈ 22 with a second pattern). Never a 2×1 "wide" dither pixel; keep dithered colours adjacent in the ramp; keep pair contrast low. Details in `rules://13-dithering-and-texture`.
10. **Heavy dither means the palette lacks the right colours** (C64 art is often dithery for that reason): first try a different swatch, then dither.
11. **PICO-8:** 2–3 palette entries per material at 8×8, 4–5 at 16×16, rarely > 7 at 32×32. `#ff004d`, `#ffa300`, `#00e436` are 100 % saturated — accents, not areas. Photo-converter confetti (stray green/blue/yellow dots) is a generated-art tell.
12. **Walk, don't hunt.** Palettes built from hue-shifted adjacent ramps (Resurrect 64, AAP-64, Apollo, Endesga 64) are used by clicking a ramp and walking it. Tiny ones (PICO-8, Sweetie 16, DB16) are assembled across families and accept 30–60° hue jumps per step.
13. **Load, order, lock.** Load the palette first (`palette` op `preset` / `set` / `load`), keep ramps adjacent in index order, paint unused slots magenta so used colours stand out, keep slot 0 transparent. `draw` and `recolor` snap to the palette: ΔE > 12 means the palette has no such colour — pick another, do not unlock.
14. **Palette-swap by slots.** Put each ramp in fixed slots; re-ramping the ends recolours the scene (day → sunset → night). For character variants make the colours that differ identical copies on the swap palette so the shapes disappear.
15. **Hi-bit has no hardware limit, so impose one:** a shared dark and a shared highlight across materials; no new colour per sprite.

## Platform limits

| platform | palette / on screen | per sprite or tile | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Game Boy (DMG) | 4 shades | BG 4; sprites 3 + transparent | 160×144; 40 sprites, 10 per line; `#081820 #346856 #88c070 #e0f8d0` (BGB) or grey `#000000 #555555 #aaaaaa #ffffff` |
| Game Boy Color | 15-bit (32,768); 8 BG × 4 + 8 sprite × 3 = up to 56 on screen | 3 + transparent | washed LCD: keep darkest above black |
| NES / Famicom | ≈ 54 usable of 64; ≈ 25 on screen (1 shared backdrop + 4×3 BG + 4×3 sprite) | 3 + transparent | BG palette chosen per 16×16 cell — neighbours share their lightest colour to hide seams; 64 sprites, 8 per line |
| Master System | 64; 32 on screen | — | |
| Game Gear | 4,096; 32 on screen | — | |
| Genesis / Mega Drive | 512; 61 on screen (4 lines × 16, index 0 transparent) | 15 + transparent | visible dither; short ramps, shared dark |
| TurboGrafx-16 | 512; 482 on screen | — | |
| SNES / Super Famicom | 32,768; 256 on screen | 15 + transparent (4 bpp); 3 + transparent (2 bpp) | jewel mids, hue-shifted short ramps, little dither |
| GBA | 32,768; 256 BG + 256 OBJ | 4 bpp = 15 + transparent per 16-colour sub-palette | bright mids; 240×160 (sub-palette split from memory in the notes) |
| C64 | 16 fixed | — | muted; Colodore/Pepto variants |
| ZX Spectrum | 15 (7 colours × 2 brightness + black) | colour clash per 8×8 attribute cell | clash rule from memory in the notes |
| MSX | 15 | 2 of 16 per 8-pixel tile line | |
| CGA | 4 per mode | 4 per small chunk | `#000000 #55ffff #ff55ff #ffffff` (palette 1 high) |
| EGA | 64; 16 on screen | any of 16 anywhere | evenly spaced RGB; artists dithered pairs |
| PICO-8 | 16 fixed (+16 hidden via remap) | 128×128, transparent is a flag | native dither fill patterns |
| GIF | 256 | — | counts transparency |

Fighting-game sprites: ≤ 16 per sprite (15 + transparent) even on late arcade hardware; selective outline adds ≈ 4 (→ 19), so cap early.
The NES master palette is not bundled: load an exact `.pal` with `palette` op `load`, do not eyeball hex.

## By size

Colours per sprite *including* outline, transparency excluded.

| | 8 px | 16 px | 32 px | 64 px |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-bit | 2 (ink + paper) | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Game Boy | 3 | 3 | 3 (+ dither sparingly) | 3 |
| NES | 3 | 3 (a 16×32 hero is also 3) | 3 per sprite object; overlaying a second sprite adds colours but costs scanline budget | — |
| PICO-8 | 2–3 | 4–5 | ≤ 7 | — |
| SNES / GBA / Genesis | 4–6 | 9–12 (Mario-class ≈ 9–12 incl. outline) | 10–15 | 15 (+ ≈ 4 selective outline) |
| free palette (hi-bit) | 4–6 | 4–8 | 8–16 | 16–24 |

Scene budgets (256-colour practice): sky 16–32 colours, every other object 3–7 (aim 3–5). A 32×64 tutorial sprite uses ≈ 16 colours in 5 ramps; an 80-tile side-view tileset fits under 50.

Built-in presets for `palette` op `preset` — about 2000: the classics `pico8`, `gameboy`, `gameboy-pocket`, `cga`, `1bit`, `grayscale-8`, plus Lospec's most-downloaded, among them `resurrect-64`, `aap-64`, `endesga-32`, `endesga-64`, `apollo`, `sweetie-16`, `dawnbringer-16`, `dawnbringer-32`, `arq4`, `aap-micro12`, `nintendo-entertainment-system`. A name that is not a key (`preset: "endesga"`) answers with the matching keys. Anything else comes from a `.gpl/.hex/.pal/.png` through op `load`.
Ramp chains that already work: PICO-8 hot `1D2B53 → 7E2553 → FF004D → FFA300 → FFEC27 → FFF1E8`, skin `AB5236 → FFCCAA` (+ `FF77A8` blush), cool `1D2B53 → 29ADFF → C2C3C7 → FFF1E8`;
Endesga 32 skin `733e39 → b86f50 → c28569 → e4a672 → e8b796 → ead4aa`, blue-grey `181425 → 262b44 → 3a4466 → 5a6988 → 8b9bb4 → c0cbdc`, green `193c3e → 265c42 → 3e8948 → 63c74d`.
Starters by task: 4 colours ARQ4 (first exercise), 12 AAP-Micro12 (small sprite), 32 DB32 (100×64 scene), 64 AAP-64 (48–64 px studies). PICO-8 has pure black but no pure white, 3 near-greys; DB16 has no pure black or white.

## Templates

One orb at each budget, light upper-left. Same form, different number of decisions.

```grid pal-orb-1bit-12

1-bit: paper is the lit side, a 50 % checker on one phase is the half-tone, ink the contour. Dither pixels never touch in a 2×1 pair, and none sits alone against the paper.

```grid pal-orb-gb4-12
O = shade-0-darkest  #081820
D = shade-1          #346856

Game Boy: four shades, the two mids carry the shading, the lightest shade is the highlight only, the darkest is the contour.

```grid pal-orb-nes3-12
O = dark-outline-and-shadow #2c1810
M = mid                     #b8481c

NES: three colours, the contour and the shadow are the *same* colour — that is how three colours become four values (outline, shadow, mid, light).

```grid pal-orb-pico8-12

PICO-8: five palette entries chained `1D2B53 → 7E2553 → AB5236 → FFA300 → FFF1E8`; the jump between entries is 30–60° of hue, which is the price of 16 colours.

```grid pal-dither-7tones-14

1 = shade-1 #346856

```

Seven tones from four shades: solid / checker / solid …, each checker 2×2 minimum. Use between adjacent ramp entries only; at 32 px and below it reads as noise except on big flat areas.

## Procedure

1. Name the platform, per-sprite colour count, tile size, and whether dither and selective outline are allowed (`rules://90-platform-styles`).
2. Load the palette: `palette` op `preset`, or op `set` with a hex list from this file, or op `load` for a `.gpl/.hex/.pal/.png`. Order ramps adjacent; slot 0 transparent; unused slots magenta while working.
3. Build ramps by walking the palette (rule 12); write the colours per material on one line before painting.
4. Paint with `draw`; leave `paletteLock` on. Count distinct colours per 8×8 block by eye with `look` op `ascii` and compare with rule 3.
5. Over budget → apply the reduction ladder (rule 5), one cut at a time, `look` op `preview` after each.
6. `palette` op `analyze` (near-duplicates, off-palette), `validate`. Export only at integer scales (`rules://14-readability-and-scale`).

## Mistakes

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| Fifth shade on a "Game Boy" sprite | palette lock off or tool widened the palette | `recolor` op `snap` to the 4 entries |
| NES sprite with 6 colours | counted outline separately | outline = darkest of the 3 |
| Seams between NES background cells | neighbouring palettes share no colour | share the lightest colour across cells |
| Dither speckle everywhere on a 4-shade palette | error-diffusion / random dither | hand-placed checker, big flat areas only |
| "Retro" look but wrong hues | NES/GB hex eyeballed | load the real palette |
| GB art unreadable on dark UI | darkest entry equals the background | keep contour ≥ 1 shade off the backdrop |
| Palette swap breaks shapes | variants use different slots for the shape colours | identical copies in the swap palette |
| Photo-converter confetti on PICO-8 | auto-quantised | rebuild by hand, 2–3 entries per material |

## Review

- Distinct colours per sprite ≤ the stated budget (transparency not counted); per 8×8 block ≤ per-tile limit.
- Every colour belongs to the declared palette (`validate`: no off-palette pixels).
- Touching objects use different swatches; shared swatches are on unrelated objects.
- Dither: no 2×1 pairs, only between adjacent ramp entries, none on a 16 px character.
- 4-shade art: darkest and lightest clearly apart; no mid-to-mid 1 px borders.
