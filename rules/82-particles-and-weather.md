# Particles and weather

Particles are tiny, so every one that is wrong is wrong in public: a row of rain drops on
a grid, snow that falls straight down at one speed, a pixel-noise "dust" cloud, leaves
that are green squares. This file gives the layer model, the loop arithmetic that makes
weather tile, and the drop/flake/leaf/dust frames. Big effects are in
`rules://80-vfx-fire-smoke-magic`, water in `rules://64-water`, wind-moved foliage in
`rules://63-trees-and-foliage` and `rules://45-secondary-motion`.

## Essentials

- Three layers far/mid/near: size ×2, speed ×2, value +2 steps toward near.
- Loops are arithmetic: tile `H` px, `F` frames, shift `k·H/F` per frame with wrap. Rain `H`=16, `F`=4: far 4 px, near 8 px. Snow `H`=16, `F`=8: far 1 px, near 2 px.
- No grids: same-layer particles never share a column within 4 px; hand-place, check with `look` op `ascii`.
- Rain: streak head brighter than tail, 2–3 px at 16 px; 3–4 frame splash on landing; 50–60 ms per frame. Wind slants 1 px x per 2–3 px y.
- Snow: 1 px far, 1 px mid, 2×2 near, S-curve drift (near x-offsets `0 +1 +1 0 −1 −1 0 +1`); 100–120 ms.
- Leaves: 4 tumble frames at 125 ms, fall 1 px/frame on a sine path; near ≈ 6×5, far ≈ 3×3.
- Dust is born on the ground and takes the ground's colour; sparks ≤ ~8 live per 32×32.
- Overlay stays within 3 value steps of the background so sprites stay readable.

Mistakes:
- Rain looks like a grid → irregular columns, ≥ 4 px apart.
- Loop pops at the seam → shift must be `k·H/F`; blit the bottom strip to the top before translating.
- Snow falls like rain → add S-curve offsets and a slower far layer.
- Weather hides the player → thin the near layer, lower its value, darken the background.

Templates: `particles-rain-tile` (16×16 seamless rain), `particles-snow-tile` (16×16 seamless snow), `particles-leaf-1` (4-frame leaf tumble), `particles-dust-1` (3-frame landing dust). Full rules and templates: rules://82-particles-and-weather

## Rules

1. **Animate one particle at a time**, then the next. Each keeps its shape until it
   dies; lone pixels are allowed only on a particle's last frame — except 1 px rain and
   snow, which *are* the unit.
2. **Motion law:** start fast, slow down, shrink, darken or fade. Gravity acts before the
   fade. Add hue variation between particles of one burst (`rules://20-color-for-pixel-art`).
3. **Depth by three layers: far, mid, near.** Size ×2, speed ×2, value contrast +2 steps from
   far to near (derived). Far leaves are the near frame sampled at every other row and column
   (nearest neighbour); far snow moves at half the near amplitude and twice its period.
4. **Loops are arithmetic.** On a tile `H` px tall with `F` frames, a layer shifts
   `k·H/F` px per frame, `k` an integer, with wrap. Then every layer returns to its start
   on frame `F`. Pick `F` that divides `H`. Rain: `H`=16, `F`=4 → far 4 px, near 8 px per
   frame. Snow: `H`=16, `F`=8 → far 1 px, near 2 px per frame (derived).
5. **No grids.** Two particles of one layer never share a column within 4 px, and offsets
   never repeat in a pattern. Place by hand; check with `look` op `ascii`.
6. **Rain = a short vertical streak, head brighter than tail.** Near 3 px, far 2 px at 16 px
   canvases. Copy the streak down the lane over 4–5 frames; when it lands, play a 3–4
   frame splash at the impact point. Wind: slant by 1 px of x per 2–3 px of y and shift the
   loop along that diagonal. Pale blue-grey, not white, on light backgrounds.
7. **Snow = 1 px far, 1 px bright mid, 2×2 near,** falling on a gentle S-curve. Near
   flake x-offset per 2 px fallen: `0 +1 +1 0 −1 −1 0 +1` (16 px period). Far: `0 0 +1 +1
   0 0 −1 −1` per 4 px (derived). Let ~1 flake in 10 drift upward. Snow sits only on
   upward-facing surfaces. Breath puffs on a character are optional.
8. **Leaves tumble in 4 frames at 125 ms:** long diagonal → broad oval → edge-on → opposite
   diagonal. Fall 1 px/frame on a sine path; a 2×2 leaf flutters by dropping its top half
   every other frame. Near leaf ≈ 6×5, far ≈ 3×3. More wind = more leaves, faster travel
   and tumble; calm = none; all drift one direction per scene and flip together.
9. **Wind is invisible: draw what it moves.** Dust, leaves, cloth, hair, grass. Flag or hair
   waves: flow points 12 px apart moving 2 px/frame = a 6-frame loop. Tornado: stacked
   spinning discs, always the same rotation, 2 colours for depth, dust fading from the base.
10. **Dust is born on the ground and takes the ground's colour.** It accelerates fast, slows,
    becomes a swirl, then breaks into smaller bits. Landing dust only when fall speed is
    above ~50 % of terminal speed (Celeste).
11. **Sparks, embers, ash:** 1–3 px, three sizes, a sine drift, shrink then drop to a darker
    background tone, never pure white on dark. At most ~8 live particles per 32×32 area
    (derived) — "too many" is noise.
12. **Weather must not eat the sprites.** Overlay particles stay within 3 value steps of the
    background; keep the nearest layer lightest. If the sprites sink after assembly, drop
    the background layers by S −20, C −15, B +15 rather than brightening the rain.
13. **Twinkle, don't flash.** Stars: 1 px, plus, or 2×2 in 2–3 colours; a few change at a
    time, out of sync; a few bright points add rhythm. Pickup sparkle: 3–4 frames, a plus
    growing into a 4-point star and back; several variants, randomised.
14. **Palette cycling does not exist here.** The classic rain/snow-by-cycling trick needs
    engine support and a custom palette per background; draw frames instead.

## By size

| | 8 px | 16 px | 32 px | 64 px |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rain streak | 1–2 px | 2–3 px | 3–4 px | 4–6 px |
| Snow flake | 1 px | 1 px, few 2×2 | 1–2 px, plus 3×3 near | 2×2 – 3×3 |
| Leaf (near) | 2×2 | 3×3 | 6×5 | 8×7 (derived) |
| Dust puff | 4×2 | 8×4 | 10×5 | 16×8 (derived) |
| Splash | 3×1 | 5×2 | 5×3 | 9×4 (derived) |
| Twinkle | 3×3 plus | 5×5 | 5×5 / 7×7 | 7×7 |

Timing: rain 50–60 ms per frame, snow 100–120 ms, leaves 125 ms, dust 60–80 ms (derived),
sparkle 60–80 ms.

## Templates

**Rain tile, frame 0 (16×16, seamless on both axes).** Five near drops (3 px) and seven far
(2 px). For `F`=4: frame n is this tile with far rows shifted `4n`, near rows `8n`, wrapped.

**Snow tile, frame 0 (16×16, seamless).** Three near 2×2 flakes, six mid, eight far. Apply the
S-curve offsets per layer on top of the vertical shift.

**Leaf tumble, 4 frames (6×5).** Play 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 at 125 ms, drifting along the wind.
Recolour for autumn (`rules://20-color-for-pixel-art`): same shapes, orange/brown ramp.

## Procedure

1. Decide the layers (far/mid/near) and the tile `H` × `F`; write the shift per layer from
   rule 4 before drawing a single drop.
2. New sprite or layer at tile size (`sprite_manage` op `new`); draw frame 0 with `draw`
   op `grid` from a template, hand-moving offsets so no lanes align.
3. `frame` op `duplicate` to `F` frames. For each frame and layer, move the layer's pixels
   with `transform` op `translate` (`dy` = shift). Pixels that leave the bottom must
   re-enter at the top: `draw` op `blit` the bottom strip to the top before translating.
4. Add splashes: `draw` op `grid` at each streak's landing point, 3 frames.
5. `look` op `filmstrip`, then check the loop: frame `F` must lead into frame 1, and frame
   0 shifted by `H` must equal frame 0.
6. `frame` op `set_duration` (rain 50–60 ms), `tag` op `create` the loop.
7. Composite over the background for the readability check (rule 12), then run
   `validate`; expect orphan-pixel flags on rain and snow — they are the material.

## Mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Rain looks like a grid | Lanes at regular spacing | Irregular columns; ≥ 4 px between neighbours |
| Loop pops at the seam | Shift not `k·H/F` or no wrap | Re-derive the shift; copy the bottom strip to the top |
| Snow falls like rain | Constant vertical drop | Add the S-curve offsets, slower far layer |
| Leaves look like green squares | One shape, no stem or tilt | Four tumble frames, midrib and stem |
| Weather hides the player | Bright, dense near layer | Drop value, thin the near layer, darken the background |
| Dust is grey on sand | Fixed grey puff | Take the colour from the ground tile |

## Review

- [ ] Three layers differ in size, speed and value; no two lanes align.
- [ ] Filmstrip loops with no jump at the seam.
- [ ] Rain has head brighter than tail and a splash where it lands.
- [ ] Snow and leaves follow a curved path, not a straight line.
- [ ] Particles shrink or darken before vanishing; lone pixels only on last frames.
- [ ] Overlay does not reduce the contrast of sprites against the background.
