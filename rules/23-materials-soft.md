# Soft materials: cloth, skin, hair, fur, leather, scales, slime

Soft materials fail by being drawn like metal: sharp bands, a highlight on everything, texture as noise. They shade gradually, shine little or
not at all, and are told mostly by their *edge* and by where the darks sit. Hard materials are in `rules://22-materials-hard`; hair and clothing
*shapes* in `rules://35-hair-and-clothing`; faces in `rules://32-heads-and-faces`; ramp numbers in `rules://20-color-for-pixel-art`.

## Essentials

- Soft = low contrast, gradual steps, little or no specular; bone landmarks (cheekbone, knuckle, kneecap) get abrupt steps. Texture goes in the half-tone band only, never as a gradient.
- Silhouette says the material first: zig-zag = fur, scallop = cloth hem, smooth round = slime/skin, repeated arcs = scales.
- Cloth: 3 tones (lit, shadow, fold crease), cool-shifted (H 262 → 250 → 238), no highlight; 2–3 folds at 16 px, radiating from compression points.
- Skin shadow is redder first (first step 10–22° toward red, S +19…+26), cooler/violet-brown second. 3–4 skin colours, 15–25 % V gap base→shadow. Deep skin: V 10 → 86, hue travel only ≈ +18°. Eye whites never `#ffffff`.
- 16–24 px heads: two skin bands (warm top, rosy-cool bottom); add a 1–2 px red accent on nose/ear/cheek.
- Hair is a mass: 3–4 entries, highlight band 1–2 px curved over the crown toward the light, not at the hairline. Hair ≥ 2 px wide; separate from skin by colour, not black line (except ≤ 16 px).
- Fur: shade smooth first, carve tufts after; dither < 10 % of area. Leather: 1–2 px gloss on the lit edge, S ≈ 45–56. Scales: one entry per cell; below 32 px suggest them with dashes.
- Slime: four swatches (small hard spec, base, reflected light opposite the spec, shadow) plus a darker coloured outline.

Mistakes:
- Cloth like plastic → remove highlights, use fold shadows only.
- Skin dead/bruised → blue shadow; shift toward red, core violet-brown.
- Hair like a helmet → highlight at hairline or even bands; put the band on the crown, notch the silhouette.
- Scales like a checkerboard at 8–16 px → dashes, cells ≥ 4 px, pattern on part of the body.

## Rules

1. **Soft = low contrast, gradual steps, little or no specular.** Soft flesh stretches over hard bone: soft forms get gradual steps, bone landmarks (cheekbone, knuckle, kneecap, collarbone) get abrupt light/shadow steps. Without landmarks a figure reads as a blob.
2. **Texture is not a gradient.** A hand-placed patch or a restrained dither describes a material without any light-to-dark ramp. Put texture in the half-tone band only; keep highlight and core flat (`rules://13-dithering-and-texture`).
3. **The silhouette says the material first:** zig-zag edge = fur, soft scallop = cloth hem, smooth round = slime or skin, repeated arcs = scales.
4. **Cloth takes soft shadows and no highlight.** Exception: a 1 px edge catch on satin or leather. Three tones — lit, shadow, fold crease — hue-shifted cool (derived ramp below: H 262 → 250 → 238, V 78 → 58 → 40). Dark regions get less detail.
5. **Folds.** Parallel where tension is high; radiating from a compression point (elbow, clasp, pinch); perpendicular where tension is low. A fold shadows the cloth beside it. Shade the body underneath first — cloth respects the anatomy. Prints and emblems are displaced by folds. Too many folds = noise: 2–3 at 16 px. Wind moves cloth as a sine wave offset along the wind; light and shadow travel away from the source.
6. **Skin zones (32–64 px head).** Forehead warm yellow-peach (H ≈ 35, S ≈ 30, V ≈ 90). Cheeks, nose, ears reddish (H 10–15, S ≈ 45, V ≈ 80). Mouth-to-chin cool or grey (H ≈ 0 → 330, S 20–25, V ≈ 72). 16–24 px heads: two bands only, warm top and rosy-cool bottom. Add a 1–2 px red accent on the nostril wing, ear rim, cheek apex; knuckles and knees take warm reds, bony landmarks cooler tints.
7. **Skin shadow is redder first, cooler second.** Measured pairs: the first shadow step turns 10–22° toward red, S +19…+26, V unchanged or slightly lower — this is the terminator band, the most saturated warm step. The deeper core step goes cool and desaturated (violet-brown) (derived, reconciling the measured pairs with Gurney). A blue shadow on skin reads as dead.
8. **Skin gets more colours and tighter steps than other materials:** 3–4 skin colours, 15–25 % V gap between base and first shadow. Light skin travels +35…+60° over its ramp; **deep skin travels only ≈ +18°** — it needs a long value range (V 10 → 86) and almost no hue travel. Eye whites are the lightest skin tone or a cool off-white, never `#ffffff`.
9. **Light through thin flesh.** Backlit ear edge, fingertip, nostril, a terminator near the light: use the warmest, most saturated skin entry (translucency), one step wide.
10. **Hair is a mass, not strands.** 3–4 entries: undercoat, base, mid-light, highlight band. The band is 1–2 px wide, curved over the skull, offset toward the key light, at the top of the skull — not at the hairline. Hair is a colourless volume extension of the head: even black hair needs form shading (blue-black ramp).
11. **Hairline and parting.** Hair at least 2 px wide; separate from skin by colour contrast, not a black line (except at ≤ 16 px). Soft edge: one dither pixel or a one-step-lighter edge. A parting is an omitted outline pixel; strands over the face are dark colour, not black lines. At 16 px the hair silhouette is the main differentiator of characters.
12. **Fur: shade smooth first, carve tufts after.** No pillow shading; cut triangular or square tufts where they show (cheeks, top of legs); sparing checker dither where there is no room for a tuft (< 10 % of the area); stylise, do not copy photo texture. Stripes and spots wrap the contour; texture follows the form.
13. **Leather: slight gloss, not a ramp.** 1–2 px highlight on the lit edge, S ≈ 45–56 (duller than cloth, never saturated), darker toward creases. Stitches (derived): 1 px lighter dots every second pixel; wear (derived): lighter pixels on corners and edges. Leather, wood and stone are one family — rugged, no true specular.
14. **Scales** (no note covers them directly; derived from the pattern studies): **cells of one entry each,** not per-scale gradients. Light rim on top, dark arc below, rows offset by half a cell, cell size shrinking toward the silhouette (foreshortening, derived). Light zones shift the *whole cell* up or down the ramp. Do not draw every scale below 32 px — suggest them.
15. **Slime: four swatches** — small hard specular, base, reflected light, shadow — plus a darker *coloured* outline. The reflected patch sits on the side opposite the specular (light passing through). Round shapes, no sharp corners (it resists breaking); start asymmetrical. Hue steps 15–20°, as for foliage and crystal.
16. **Snow, blood, guts (brief).** Snow: warm white key, near-white light blue half-tone, blue-violet shadow (S 25–40, V 55–70), deep blue core (V 40–50), one blue-green pixel in hollows; cast shadows take the sky colour. Blood and guts: round shapes, hue variation in one material, small shiny spots for wet; orphan pixels only at very low res or on a particle's last frame.

Slime: hard 2-px specular upper-left, reflected patch lower-right, coloured dark outline, flat bottom with a shadow rim.

## Procedure

1. Choose the material row from the table and set its ramp with `palette` op `set`; decide the light (`rules://24-lighting-scenarios`).
2. Draw the silhouette with the material's edge signature (rule 3); `look` op `preview`.
3. Fill the base tone; add *one* shadow step in the shadow side; for skin make that step the terminator (rule 7).
4. Add the material's structure: folds (cloth), highlight band (hair), tuft notches (fur), stitch row (leather), scale cells (scales), spec + reflected patch (slime). Draw with `draw` ops `polyline`/`pixels`, or transcribe a template with op `grid`.
5. Add the deep core step and bounce only if the size allows (see By size); no highlight on cloth, fur, scales.
6. For skin add the warm accent pixels and the eye-white check (lightest skin tone, not white).
7. `look` op `ascii`: no orphan pixels, no 2×1 dither pairs, folds not parallel everywhere. `validate`.

## Mistakes

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| Cloth looks like plastic or metal | highlight pixels, hard bands | remove highlights; fold shadows only |
| Cloth looks scribbled | too many folds | 2–3 folds at 16 px; radiate from a compression point |
| Skin looks dead / bruised | blue shadow | shadow toward red, core violet-brown |
| Skin looks like clay | one skin ramp for every tone, same hue travel | deep skin: long V range, +18° travel |
| Hair looks like a helmet or a wig | highlight at the hairline, even bands, per-strand lines | band on top of the skull, offset to the light, silhouette notches |
| Black outline eats the hairline | outline on hair/skin border | colour contrast or dither pixel at ≤ 24 px; dark hair colour at the border |
| Fur looks like noise | random speckle | smooth shade first, then carved tufts, dither < 10 % |
| Leather looks like cardboard or cloth | no gloss pixel, too saturated | 1–2 px gloss on the edge, S ≈ 45–56 |
| Scales look like a checkerboard | per-pixel pattern at 8–16 px | dashes, cells of ≥ 4 px, pattern only on part of the body |
| Slime looks like a green ball | no reflected patch, no coloured outline | add the opposite-side reflection and a dark teal outline |

## Review

- No specular on cloth, fur, scales, hair (a band is not a specular); leather has at most a 2 px gloss.
- Skin shadow is redder than the base before it is cooler; no blue or black skin shadows; eye whites are not `#ffffff`.
- Dark skin shows a long value range, not a hue rotation.
- Hair highlight sits on the crown on the lit side, ≥ 2 px thick hair, soft hairline; the silhouette is distinct.
- Fur edge zig-zags in ≥ 2 px steps; interior dither < 10 %.
- Slime has all four swatches and a coloured outline.
- Folds radiate or run parallel for a reason; no uniform stripes.
