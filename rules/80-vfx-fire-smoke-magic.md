# VFX: fire, smoke, explosions and magic

Effects are judged by motion alone, and agents draw them as stills: a flame with a black
outline, smoke as a grey ball, an explosion as one orange frame. Each effect has a fixed
layer order, colour order and frame skeleton; this file gives them. Hit timing and shake
are in `rules://81-impacts-and-game-feel`, falling things in `rules://82-particles-and-weather`,
light cast on the scene in `rules://24-lighting-scenarios`.

## Essentials

- One `layer` per element (flash, blast, fire, smoke, debris); animate each, then judge the stack.
- No black outline on light sources: outer ring is darkest fire colour. Ramp `#ac3232` → `#df7126` → `#fbf236` → `#ffffff`; white is 1–3 px at the root, never a fill.
- Fire loops 6–8 frames (≤16 px: 4) at 80–120 ms, uneven (100/80/120/100); last frame leads into first.
- Flame = one connected body + 1 px embers. 32 px torch: 9–12 wide, 15–20 tall, tip ±3–4 px per frame. Wind leans the tip (top 2–3 rows), not the base.
- Smoke rises 2–3 px/frame, widens, lightens (3 → 2 colours), breaks into 2–4 clusters late. Violet-grey, never neutral.
- Explosion ≥4 frames: dark disc → white flash → sharp blast → fade (fire leaves fast, smoke slow). 32 px radius gains ~+4, +3, +2, +1, +1 px.
- Glow = concentric rings 1–2 px each, outer ring dithered; no alpha. Beams: white core, 1 px coloured fringe, pulse 1→3→5→3→1 px.
- Debris obeys gravity and rests on the last frame.

Mistakes:
- Flame looks like a sticker → remove the outline; put a dark disc behind on frame 1.
- Effect strobes → vary frame durations and shapes; start a new wave every 2–3 frames.
- Smoke reads as noise or grey ball → shrink and break up late; lobed discs with one dark lower-right crescent.
- Explosion is one orange frame → draw the 4-beat sequence, each pass on its own layer.

Templates: `vfx-flame-1` (torch flame, 3 frames 9×12), `vfx-smoke-1` (smoke puff cycle), `vfx-explosion-1` (flash→fade, 4 frames 13×13), `vfx-orb-glow` (ring glow orb). Full rules and templates: rules://80-vfx-fire-smoke-magic

## Rules

1. **One layer at a time.** An explosion is flash, blast, fire, smoke, debris: draw and
   animate each as its own pass (own `layer`), then judge the stack. One drawing per frame
   comes out muddy.
2. **Light sources get no black outline.** The outer ring of a flame or blast is the darkest
   *fire* colour, then orange, yellow, white. An outline turns glow into a sticker. Contrast
   comes from a dark disc *behind* the effect on frame 1 (rule 9).
3. **Fire ramp, hottest at the base:** `#ac3232` dark red, `#df7126` orange, `#fbf236` yellow,
   `#ffffff` white (add `#3f2832` as a darkest step). White is 1–3 pixels at the root of a flame
   or centre of a blast, never a fill. The tip is the coolest part.
4. **A flame is one connected body plus a few detached bits.** The body changes outline every
   frame but keeps its area; embers (1 px) break off the tip and rise. Yellow stays inside
   orange. Measured torch at 32 px: 9–12 wide, 15–20 tall, tip height ±3–4 px between frames.
5. **Fire loops in 6–8 frames at 80–120 ms with uneven durations** (e.g. 100/80/120/100).
   Start a new "wave" every 2–3 frames; the last frame must lead into the first. At ≤16 px
   4 frames suffice. *Conflict:* the Saint11 reference fire is 30 frames at 100 ms; at ≤32 px
   the extra frames are indistinguishable, so use 6–8. Equal frames and durations strobe.
6. **Wind leans the tip, not the base:** shift the top 2–3 rows by 1 px, keep the bottom.
7. **Smoke dies by shrinking, not transparency.** Each frame rise 2–3 px, widen, lighten toward
   the background (3 → 2 colours), and finally break into 2–4 clusters. Break late; early
   breakup reads as noise. Violet-grey, never neutral (`rules://20-color-for-pixel-art`).
8. **Smoke puffs are lobed discs:** light crescent upper-left, one dark crescent lower-right,
   bumps on top. No pillow shading (`rules://11-clusters-and-noise`).
9. **Explosion: at least 4 frames, in order:** (1) contrast — a dark disc, so the next frame
   feels brighter; (2) white flash; (3) sharp blast, hard angles, no noise; (4+) fade — fire
   leaves fast, smoke slowly. Draw the *force shape* first: sphere in open air, half-dome on
   a wall, quarter-dome in a corner.
10. **Expansion is fast, then slows;** in a 6-frame, 32 px blast the radius gains about
    +4, +3, +2, +1, +1 px (derived). Colour runs white → yellow → orange → brown/grey, so the
    last frames carry no yellow.
11. **Debris follows gravity and lands.** Nothing hangs mid-air; fragments rest on the last frame.
12. **Electricity flickers:** shock (sharp zig-zag) → brighter frame with a *different* shape →
    empty → faded echo of the first → empty → 2-frame fade. Blank frames are part of it.
13. **Beams: white core, 1 px coloured fringe;** pulse thickness 1 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 1 px, with a
    charge ball at the muzzle first.
14. **Glow is concentric rings, not alpha:** core → light → mid → dark, 1–2 px per ring, outer
    ring dithered (`rules://13-dithering-and-texture`). Light it casts drops about 2 ramp steps
    per doubling of distance (`rules://24-lighting-scenarios`).
15. **Pick the magic palette by the feeling.** Dark magic: complementary pair (lime `#99e550`
    against purple `#c327ff`), lit from below, sharp shapes, spiral smoke, black disc behind.
    Holy magic: analogous and bright (cyan, white, yellow), lit from above, rounded shapes,
    sparks that fall slowly or rise, no smoke, no spikes.
16. **Projectile cores are warm and bright, borders cool and dark:** orange `#fee761 #feae34
    #f77622 #9e2835`; cyan `#ffffff #2ce8f5 #0095e9 #124e89`; green `#fee761 #63c74d #3e8948
    #265c42`. Fast bullets: fewer details, stretched along travel.

## By size

| Canvas | Flame | Smoke puff | Explosion | Glow / orb |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 8 px | 4–5 × 6–8, 2 colours, 3 frames | 3–4 px blob, 3 frames | 3 frames: white disc, yellow star, 2 dots | 2 rings |
| 16 px | 7–9 × 9–12, 3 colours + 1–2 white px, 4 frames | 6–8 px, 3 colours, 4 frames | 11–13 px, 4 frames | 3 rings (11 px) |
| 32 px | 9–12 × 15–20, 4 colours, 6–8 frames, 2–4 embers | 10–16 px lobed, 5–6 frames | 24–32 px, 6 frames + debris | 4 rings, dithered edge |
| 64 px | 2–3 tongues in one body, 8 frames | staggered puffs | 8 frames: rings → fireball → smoke column | layered glow + rays |

Budget at 16 px: ≤ 70 filled pixels and ≤ 2 detached per flame frame; ≤ 3 clusters per smoke frame.

## Templates

All frames share one canvas size per effect so they stack in one sprite; colours are
roles — map them to your palette (`rules://21-limited-and-platform-palettes`).

**Torch flame, 3 frames (9×12).** Upright, lean-right, short with a detached spark.
For a lean-left frame mirror `vfx-flame-2` (`transform` op `flip`) and shift the yellow
core sliver by 1 px. Play with uneven durations.

```grid vfx-flame-1

O = fire-mid    #df7126

**Smoke puff, 4-frame cycle (12×16), frames 1–3 drawn.** One puff rising from the bottom
edge: forms, swells, turns ragged and light. Frame 4 is 3–4 clusters of 2–3 px (`M`/`L`
only) over the top 6 rows; only the last frame may hold lone pixels. Same origin for all.

**Explosion, 4 frames (13×13).** Frame 0 (not drawn here) is a dark disc of about
7 px, `#222034`, via `draw` op `ellipse`. Then flash, sharp blast, fireball, fade.
Hold flash and blast for 1 tick each (40–60 ms), fireball 80 ms, fade 100–120 ms (derived).

**Magic orb (11×11).** Ring glow: one frame, or pulse by swapping the ring colours
one step outward each frame. Dither the outer `N` ring for a soft edge.

```grid vfx-orb-glow

**Lightning bolt, 2 frames (9×12).** Frame 1 thin and sharp (2 px segments on 1:1 diagonals joined by horizontal kinks); frame 2 a white core in a
halo, mirrored so the shape changes. Order: 1, 2, empty, 1 at half the colour, empty, gone.

```grid vfx-bolt-1

## Procedure

1. Fix the feeling and the ramp: `palette` op `set` with the 4–5 role colours, or `palette` op
   `ramp` from `#df7126` if the project palette lacks a fire ramp.
2. Make a transparent `fx` layer (`layer` op `create`); `frame` op `add` to the frame count.
3. Draw each frame with `draw` op `grid` from a template, same origin on every frame.
4. `look` op `filmstrip`, then `look` op `onion` on middle frames: the body keeps its
   volume and the tip travels, not teleports.
5. `frame` op `set_duration` with uneven values; `tag` op `create` the loop (`fire-loop`) or
   one-shot (`explosion`).
6. `validate` flags single-pixel sparks as orphans: expected on embers and last-frame debris;
   anything else is a defect.

## Mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Flame is a sticker | Black outline, flat orange | Dark-red rim, 3 inner tones |
| Fire strobes | Equal frames and durations | Uneven durations, tip ±2–3 px |
| Smoke is a rock | Pillow shading, opaque grey, no breakup | Lobed top, one dark crescent, break into clusters |
| Explosion lacks punch | Went straight to the fireball | Add dark contrast frame and white flash |
| Lightning looks like a crack | One constant frame | Alternate shapes with blank frames |

## Review

- [ ] No black outline on light sources; darkest ring is a fire/magic colour.
- [ ] Yellow is enclosed by orange; white covers ≤ 5 % of a flame frame.
- [ ] Filmstrip: body area steady (±15 %), tip wobbles, loop closes.
- [ ] Explosion has contrast, flash, blast, fade in order (≥ 4 frames).
- [ ] Smoke lightens and breaks into clusters; no flat grey disc.
- [ ] Palette matches the feeling (dark vs holy).
